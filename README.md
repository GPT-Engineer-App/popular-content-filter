# popular-content-filter

The following is my assumed short description of an SPA and would like you to review it in regards to your capabilities and then suggest a way of reaching a desired outcome 

### Short Description
The Most Watched Content Page displays the currently most-watched movies and TV shows with filter and sort options. It integrates ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, OMDb, and TMDb. Additionally, it provides a weekly summary and offers genre filtering.

### Prompt Explanation
The Most Watched Content Page is designed to showcase popular content, allowing users to filter by type (movies/shows) and genre, and sort by views, rating, or date. It integrates multiple APIs (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, OMDb, TMDb) to retrieve comprehensive ratings and movie data. A weekly summary highlights trends, and the page dynamically updates based on user-selected filters and sorting criteria. The page is built using React and Chakra UI, with Axios handling API requests.

### Sequenced Approach to Developing the Features

#### Task 1: Set Up Project Environment
- **Objective:** Prepare the development environment with necessary tools and dependencies.
- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize a new React project.
  2. Install Chakra UI for styling.

  3. Modify `MostWatchedContent.jsx` to call these APIs and fetch content data.
  4. Update state variables with fetched data and handle loading states.

#### Task 4: Implement Filtering and Sorting
- **Objective:** Enable users to filter and sort content.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add dropdowns for filtering by type and genre, and sorting options.
  2. Update API calls to include selected filter and sort criteria.
  3. Ensure content updates dynamically based on user selections.

#### Task 5: Display Weekly Summary
- **Objective:** Provide a summary of the most-watched content for the week.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add a section in `MostWatchedContent.jsx` for the weekly summary.
  2. Fetch summary data from the API.
  3. Display the weekly summary in the designated section.

#### Task 6: UI/UX Enhancements
- **Objective:** Improve the user interface and user experience.
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement better loading animations.
  2. Add error handling for API requests.
  3. Refine the design for better usability and visual appeal.

#### Task 7: Implement Trending Content Recommendations
- **Objective:** Provide recommendations based on currently trending content.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify trending content using API data.
  2. Create a new component to display recommendations.
  3. Integrate this component into the main page, ensuring it updates dynamically.

#### Task 8: User Interaction Features
